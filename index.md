Hi, I am Diego and welcome to my academic space!

This Fall, I will be joining the [CSSE department](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng.html){:target="_blank"} of [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/){:target="_blank"} as an Assistant Professor in Software Engineering. 

> - If you are interested in joining my research group, please check the [prospective students](/prospective-students/){:target="_blank"} page.

<!-- I am also part of the [LATECE](http://latece.uqam.ca/) research group.  -->
Before, I worked as an Assistant Professor with the Computer Science department at [UQAM](www.uqam.ca){:target="_blank"} in Montréal, Canada. 
I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/){:target="_blank"}, Canada, working with Prof. [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/){:target="_blank"}. I received my PhD from Heidelberg University, Germany in the [Parallel and Distributed Systems Group](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/home/){:target="_blank"} of [Prof. Andrzejak](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/team/aa/){:target="_blank"}. 


I am interested in Software Engineering Research. In a few words, I want to reduce the burden on software developers by tackling aspects related to **software maintenance** and **software performance**. 
I like to leverage historical project data (e.g., GitHub) through Data Mining methods and apply Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis techniques to understand the problems developers face and provide insights/solutions to alleviate the issues. 

For details about my research, please check my [publication list](/publications/){:target="_blank"}.
