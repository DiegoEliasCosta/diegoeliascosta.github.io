**I am in the job market!**


Hi, I am Diego and welcome to my academic space!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/){:target="_blank"}, Canada, working at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering in the [DAS Lab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/){:target="_blank"} of Prof. [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I was doing my PhD at Heidelberg University, Germany in the [Parallel and Distributed Systems Group](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/home/){:target="_blank"} of [Prof. Andrzejak](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/team/aa/){:target="_blank"}. 


I am interested in Software Engineering Research. In a few words, I want to reduce the burden on software developers by tackling aspects related to **software maintenance** and **software performance**. 
I like to leverage historical project data (e.g., GitHub) through Data Mining methods and apply Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis techniques to understand the problems developers face and provide insights/solutions to alleviate the issues. 

For details about my research, please check my [publication list](/publications/){:target="_blank"}.
