I am always on the lookout for hiring self-motivated MSc and PhD students to work on topics related to software engineering. Currently, I am focused on three major research topics:
- **Dependency Management.** How to help software maintainers at reusing open source libraries without risking the quality, security and stability of their systems?  
- **Performance Regression Testing.** How can we help software developers identify when their systems are slower, consume more energy, or use more memory than before?
- **Software Engineering for AI systems.** AI systems are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives. How can we help software developers to build more reliable AI systems?

```
**Disclaimer** While many of my past works are related to Artificial Intelligence, my research is **not focused in developping better AI methods**. We use AI/ML/LLM to better help software developpers to deliver better quality software. That said, if you are looking for an AI-driven group, this is not the right place for you.
```

A few good reasons to join our lab:
- You will be working on indutry-relevant problems that have a direct impact on the software industry.
- Montreal is one of the best cities to study in the world.
- Concordia University is one of the [top universities under 50 years old](https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2022/02/25/concordia-remains-tops-under-50-in-canada.html?c=/news/archive){:target="_blank"}.
- Concordia figures at the top in [Software Engineering research in the last few years](https://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&ca){:target="_blank"}.

**Qualifications:** Strong programming, problem-solving and communication skills. A degree in computer science, computer engineering or software engineering is expected. However, if you have a major in adjacent areas (e.g., electrical engineering, mathematics, physics) and have a strong programming background, you are also encouraged to apply. If you come from a completely different area, you should include strong arguments as to why you want to switch to software engineering.

If you are interested in joining my research group, please contact (diego.costa [at] concordia.ca) and include:
- Your CV
- Brief cover letter including: your research interests, outline of previous research experience, preferred start date. You get a bonus point if you include which research topic you are interested on, or which papers from our group has caught your attention (see [Publications](./publications.md){:target="_blank"}).
- Your (unofficial) transcripts


Please note:
- Make sure to show in your email that you are actually interested in our work. Generic application e-mails (especially those that are addressed to multiple professors!) **will be ignored**.
- Take a look at the Concordia application website
