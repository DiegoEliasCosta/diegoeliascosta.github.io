## Background and Education

I am from Brazil, and I did both my undergrad and my MSc. degrees at the Federal University of Uberlândia. 
During my master's, I worked on analyzing the performance of memory allocators with Dr. Rivalino Matias. 
At that time, I got the opportunity to work with Dr. Artur Andrejak on a project related to software aging. 
This collaboration went super well and prof. Artur Andrzejak was kind enough to invite me to apply for a scholarship at Heidelberg University.

## Hobbies

When writing this list, I realized I have quite a handful of hobbies. 
I don't have nearly enough time to dedicate to these activities anymore, so I am mostly an enthusiast nowadays. 

- **Guitar playing.** I have been on a handful of rock bands in my youth and still play guitar regularly. I was playing guitar way before I ever touched a computer and wanted to be a professional musician for a long time. I am super glad I didn't because I got to keep my hobby while still working on a kick-ass field. 

- **Football** A Brazilian that likes football? How original. I used to play football a lot and have always loved the game. I try to watch games from some major league, and I support my local team, Cruzeiro (the greatest of Minas).
  
- **Videogames.** Videogames was the main reason I ended up choosing Computer Science instead of any other engineering major. My first contact with programming was through the RPG Maker, a platform where we could develop (old-school) RPG games, and sometimes needed to program in Ruby. Today, I am still fond of RPG and try to play some of them when I have time.

- **Movies and Series.** Fantasy and Scify are my favorite genre, but we watch anything good. Except for horror movies. I can't stand them. 

- **Board games.** This one I picked up more recently in the urge to transport some of the fun with games to the analogic world. I try to play board games with my wife somewhat regularly.
