We are hiring! As I am seting up my research group at Concordia University, I am looking to hire self-motivated MSc and PhD students to work on topics related to software engineering. Currently, I am focused on three major research topics:
- **Dependency Management.** How to help software maintainers at reusing open source libraries without risking the quality, security and stability of their systems?  
- **Performance Regression Testing.** How can we help software developers to test their systems to identify when their systems are slower, consume more energy, or use more memory than before?
- **Software Engineering for AI systems.** AI systems are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives. How can we help software developers to build more reliable AI systems?


**Disclaimer** While many of my past works are related to Artificial Intelligence, my research is **not focused in developping better AI methods**. We use AI/ML/LLM to better help software developpers to deliver better quality software. That said, if you are looking for an AI-driven group, this is not the right place for you.


**Qualifications:** Strong programming, problem-solving and communication skills. A degree in computer science, computer engineering or software engineering is expected. However, if you have a major in adjacent areas (e.g., electrical engineering, mathematics, physics) and have a strong programming background, you are also encouraged to apply. If you come from a completely different are, you will have to persuade us about why you want to switch to software engineering.


If you are interested in joining my research group, please contact (diego.costa [at] concordia.ca) and include:
- Your CV
- Brief cover letter including: your research interests, outline of previous research experience, preferred start date. You get a bonus point if you include which research topic you are interested on. 
- Your (unofficial) transcripts


Please note:
- Make sure to show in your email that you are actually interested in our work. Generic application e-mails (especially those that are addressed to multiple professors!) **will be ignored**.
